            <h1 class="margin text-center"><span id="sigma">Movie</span> Webpage Project</h1>

            <h2>Contextual Information:</h2>
            <p id="center">Overview of the project and the objective!</p>
            <p>After learning HTML and CSS for two months, Mr. Mueller wanted to test our skills and knowledge by giving us a project. 
            Prompt required that you create a webpage that promotes a fake/made up movie. The requirements included headings, paragraphs, 
            spans, divs, & images. Showing understanding of spacing, alignment, and simple styling was very crucial to success during this project.
            This project was meant to test your ability to plan a page, write readable code, and present content in a simple format. 
            I worked with my friend Jasmina during the project. She was great, flexible, and easy to work with.</p>
            
            <h2>Content:</h2>
            <p id="center">What's on my website, well look below!</p>
            <p>Content required a full movie webpage built with the HTML and CSS skills we learned, apart of the project came with rules and one of those is images that were Creative Commons or our own.
                We needed headings, paragraphs, divs, spans, input fields, submit buttons, element selectors, class selectors, and id selectors. We also, needed to utilize the box model with padding, margin, and border. 
                A plan being written & contrusted in markdown was extremely crucial, as markdown helped break the work into way simpler tasks as It showed who handled each part. During this project, I worked with a partner
                and her name is Jasmina. We both did a part in everything and evenly split the sections.</p>

            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
            <p id="center">Brief and short explaination of my challenges, what went wrong and how it was for me.</p>
            <p>The project was easy and understandable, and I was able to follow the instructions without difficulty.</p>
            <p>I worked with Jasmina, we both handled the visual elements, and we both focused on the structure.</p>
            <p>A minor frustration I faced was centering images, as it kept changing everything and getting me upset. I will also never forget adjusting their size, and getting div elements to align correctly, these were most definitely
            major frustrations as these drove me and Jasmina insane.
            </p>

            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
            <p id=""center>Takeaways were extremely simple.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Planning saves time, and clear writing helps the reader.</li>
            <li>Working with Jasmina made the work easier, as she stayed flexible and steady.</li>
            <li>We divided tasks fairly and communicated effectively, which improved the final result.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
            <p id="center">These are the things I am probably going to be looking forward to doing.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Changing the layout, improving spacing, and revising the project.</li>
            <li>I want to refine the CSS for cleaner structure as it doesn't look very pleasant to me.</li>
            <li>I want to extend the content section with more detail about the fictional movie.</li>
            <li>I want to test more visual options to increase clarity, maybe adding a gradient on the background would help.</li>
            <li>I want to continue reducing clutter so the page stays simple and readable, the page doesn't really look too good.</li>
            </ul>
